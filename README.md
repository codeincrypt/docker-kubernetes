# Docker & Kubernetes

Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.

This README provides an overview of Docker, its purpose, and how it helps in deploying applications efficiently using containers. It includes guides for setting up React (CRA & Vite) and Node.js applications in Docker and Kubernetes.
